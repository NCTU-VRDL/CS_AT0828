## HW5: Deep neural network, due date: June 12, 23:59

### Goals

In this coding assignment,  you need to implement the deep neural network by any deep learning framework, e.g. Pytorch, TensorFlow, or Keras, then train the DNN model by the Cifar-10 dataset. 

### Dataset
Download dataset [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vI8Bkk5DojitLNkpz-UT30jOEay0XXon?usp=sharing). Please note that you should only train and evaluate your model on the provided dataset. **DO NOT** download the data from other resources.
